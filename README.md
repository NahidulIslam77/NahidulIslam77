## Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹ 

Hello! I'm Nahidul Islam. Iâ€™m from Bangladesh and currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at United International University. 

I enjoy coding. I'm a beginner in competitive programming, I first got into it to strengthen my combinatorics, but now I do it because I liked it. Especially when it challenges me to think critically and solve complex problems. I use C++ and java for cp, and Iâ€™m constantly learning and improving through contests on platforms like Codeforces and HackerRank. 

Outside of programming, Iâ€™m a big fan of cricket, football, and tennis. In my free time, I love playing football and listening to music. 

Iâ€™m deeply interested in Machine Learning, AI, and web development. The idea of building intelligent systems that can solve real world problems excites me and Iâ€™m passionate about exploring these areas further in the future.
